Thank you for downloading our unofficial expansion for C&C Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge - Mental Omega.

To make Mental Omega (3.3.6) work on your computer, follow these instructions:

#1. Mental Omega is not a standalone mod, but it does not require a game CD to be played.
It requires the following files from C&C Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge, patched to version 1.001:

- BINKW32.dll
- BLOWFISH.dll
- gamemd.exe (patched to version 1.001 - from original CD, The First Decade or The Ultimate Collection release)
- ra2.mix
- ra2md.mix
- language.mix
- langmd.mix

#2. Either extract all the contents of Mental Omega 3.3.0 archive to the location
of your Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge installation, or copy the game's directory,
rename it and extract all of the mod archive contents to the copied folder. 

Make sure no other modifications are installed in the directory where Mental Omega will be.

You can also simply create an empty directory, copy the 7 files listed earlier to it
and extract the contents of Mental Omega 3.3.0 archive to the newly created directory.

The following is advised if you are playing Red Alert 2 Yuri's Revenge multiplayer on CnCNet:
DO NOT extract Mental Omega 3.3.0 files to the folder where Yuri's Revenge with CnCNet is installed.

#3. If you have downloaded Mental Omega music files, extract thememo.mix and expandmo94.mix to the mod's location.
!! If you wish to use the original Red Alert 2 & Yuri's Revenge soundtracks, enable 'Global Soundtrack' in Options,
then copy theme.mix and thememd.mix from CDs to the mod folder, renaming them as expandmo10.mix and expandmo11.mix.

#4. Run MentalOmegaClient.exe, patch the game to version 3.3.6, configure the settings and play campaign, skirmish or multiplayer on CnCNet.


Enjoy!
